    "바로 이전 모듈에서 기존에 온프레미스에서 개발했던 환경과 동일한 환경으로 모델을 빌드하고 훈련했습니다. 하지만 아래와 같은 상황들에서도 기존 환경을 사용하는 것이 바람직할까요?\n",
    "\n",
    "- 온프레미스의 GPU는 총 1장으로 훈련 시간이 너무 오래 소요됨\n",
    "- 가용 서버 대수가 2대인데 10개의 딥러닝 모델을 동시에 훈련해야 함\n",
    "- 필요한 상황에만 GPU를 활용\n",
    "- 기타 등등\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker는 데이터 과학자들 및 머신 러닝 엔지니어들을 위한 완전 관리형 머신 러닝 서비스로 훈련 및 추론 수행 시 인프라 설정에 대한 추가 작업이 필요하지 않기에, 단일 GPU 기반의 딥러닝 훈련을 포함한 멀티 GPU 및 멀티 인스턴스 분산 훈련을 보다 쉽고 빠르게 수행할 수 있습니다. SageMaker는 다양한 유즈케이스들에 적합한 예제들을 지속적으로 업데이트하고 있으며, 한국어 세션 및 자료들도 제공되고 있습니다.\n",

    "이미 기본적인 Hugging Face 용법 및 자연어 처리에 익숙하신 분들은 앞 모듈을 생략하고 이 모듈부터 핸즈온을 시작하셔도 됩니다.\n",
    "이 노트북은 SageMaker 기본 API를 참조하므로, SageMaker Studio, SageMaker 노트북 인스턴스 또는 AWS CLI가 설정된 로컬 시스템에서 실행해야 합니다. SageMaker Studio 또는 SageMaker 노트북 인스턴스를 사용하는 경우 PyTorch 기반 커널을 선택하세요.\n",
    "훈련 job 수행 시 최소 `ml.g4dn.xlarge` 이상의 훈련 인스턴스가 필요하며, `ml.p3.8xlarge`나 `ml.p3.16xlarge` 인스턴스를 권장합니다. 만약 인스턴스 사용에 제한이 걸려 있다면 Request a service quota increase for SageMaker resources를 참조하여 인스턴스 제한을 해제해 주세요.\n",
